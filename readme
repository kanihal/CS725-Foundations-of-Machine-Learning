To run the code: 
Import class and create object. Sample code:
	from autoML import AutoRegressor
	import time
	import numpy as np
	ar = autoRegressor(trainCsvFile=csvFile, testCsvFile=csvFileTest, yLabel=yLabel)
	ar.preProcessDataUsingPandas()
	ar.splitter()
	ar.lasso()

Here trainCsvFile is filename training data csv file, testCsvFile is filename of test data csv file,
yLabel is the label of the target column in the training data csv file

sample test.py file is given.
